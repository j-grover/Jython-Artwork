### Rainbow image

A rainbow effect applied to the leaves of the tree by finding the pixels closest to green in the tree. Each pixels color modified based upon the sin and cosine of its location, creating a rainbow effect.

### Sun Rain image

A yellow filter applied to half of the image and a yellow sun created out of a circle. The sun had a blur effect added to it. The other half of the image modified to be black and white. Rain drops generated randomly and placed on the image.

### Light Night image

Half of the image darkened by reducing all of the pixels color values, the blue value was reduced by a lower amount to help increase the effect. A moon was generated and blurred. The other half of the image had a negative filter applied with an lightning bolt copied onto the image.

### Snow image

Snow was randomly generated around the tree by producing different sized and coloured circles. The pixels in the ground were converted to white if there value was close to yellow. This created a layer of snow on the ground. The same technique was applied to the tree leaves, creating the effect of snow on the leaves.
